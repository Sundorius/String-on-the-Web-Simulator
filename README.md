This is a personal project.

This is a program created with JAVA, that displays a window to select one or more.txt files, from which it reads the words and stores them
in a tree structure and displays them to the user in descending order, and their frequency of occurrence.
It supports word locating, which if found in the tree, displays the name of the files containing it, based on the frequency of occurrence in each file.
