This is a personal project.

This is a program created with JAVA, that displays a window to select one or more.txt files, from which it reads the words and stores them in a tree structure and displays them to the user in descending order, and their frequency of occurrence.
It supports word locating, where if a word is found in the tree, it displays the name of the files containing it, based on the frequency of occurrence in each file.
